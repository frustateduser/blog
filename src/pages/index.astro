        <h1>Welcome 👋</h1>
        <p>
          Hi, I’m <strong>Koustubh Badshah</strong> — a computer science enthusiast
          with a strong interest in cybersecurity, systems, and hands-on problem solving.
          This blog is my personal space to document what I learn, build, break, and
          understand along the way.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I believe the best way to learn computer science is by doing. Most of
          my learning comes from practical challenges, experiments, and
          real-world simulations rather than just theory. I actively work on
          platforms like Hack The Box (HTB), exploring networks, operating
          systems, authentication mechanisms, and security misconfigurations.
        </p>

        <p>
          I enjoy digging deep into how things work under the hood — whether
          it’s Linux internals, networking protocols, web technologies, or
          security tooling. When something breaks, I like to trace it back to <em
            >why</em
          > it broke, not just how to fix it.
        </p>

        <h2>Building & Creating</h2>
        <p>
          Alongside learning and writing, I enjoy building projects and
          experimenting with new software. Creating things from scratch helps me
          connect concepts across different areas of computer science and turn
          abstract ideas into something real and usable.
        </p>

        <p>
          My projects often involve a mix of security, backend systems,
          networking, automation, and modern web technologies. Whether it’s a
          small tool, a lab setup, or a full application, I focus on writing
          clean, understandable, and purposeful code.
        </p>

      <section class="blogs">
        <h2>What You’ll Find Here</h2>
        <p>
          This blog primarily focuses on <strong>CTF writeups</strong> and <strong
            >technical content</strong
          >
          across different areas of computer science. Each post is written with clarity
          and learning in mind — both for my future self and for anyone walking a
          similar path.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>CTF & HTB Writeups</strong> – Step-by-step breakdowns of challenges,
            covering enumeration, exploitation, misconfigurations, and lessons learned
            (only for retired or allowed machines).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cybersecurity Concepts</strong> – Networking, Wi-Fi security,
            authentication protocols, Linux security, and practical attack/defense
            techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Technical Deep Dives</strong> – Clear explanations of tools, commands,
            workflows, and system behavior.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>General Computer Science</strong> – Topics that spark curiosity
            across software, systems, and infrastructure.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="philosophy">
        <h2>Why I Write</h2>
        <p>
          Writing helps me solidify my understanding and track my growth over
          time. Instead of just solving a challenge and moving on, I document
          the reasoning, mistakes, and insights that matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you’re a student, beginner, or someone transitioning into
          cybersecurity or deeper technical roles, I hope these posts help you
          think more clearly and approach problems with confidence.
        </p>
